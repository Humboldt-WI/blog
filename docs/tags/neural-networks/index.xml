      <description>Authors: Jakub Kondek, Karim Chennoufi, Kevin Noessler Introduction Motivation The increasing popularity of websites such as Instagram, Facebook or Youtube has lead to an increase in visual data over the last few years. These websites have become part of everyday life for many people and are therefore used excessively. The use of such websites has contributed among other things to enormously increasing amount of visual data in the process. Every day thousands of images and videos are uploaded, making it virtually impossible to analyze them by hand, as the sheer mass of content does not allow it.</description>

      <description>Authors: Gabriel Blumenstock, Yu Fan, Yang Tian Introduction What are generative models? In machine learning, generative models are used to generate new samples following the same distribution of the original data using unsupervised learning algorithms. Such methods provide a powerful way to detect and analyze enormous information of data, which has been applied to various domains, e.g. images and texts. By learning the statistical latent space of images or stories, the models are able to obtain human experiences and then “create” similar meaningful outputs.</description>

      <description>Crime and Neural Nets&amp;#182;Introducing Recurrent Neural Networks with Long-Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit to predict reported Crime Incidents&amp;#182;Carolin Kunze, Marc Scheu, Thomas Siskos&amp;#182;Several police departments across the Unites States have been experimenting with software for crime prdiction. This started a controversial debate: Critics are questioning the predictiv power of the underlying machine learning models and point out biases towards certain crime typs and neighborhoods. We took this as occacion to look into the publicly available crime records of the city of chicago.</description>

      <description>Neural Network Fundamentals Authors: Mahdi Bayat, Denis Augusto Pinto Maciel, Roman Proskalovich This blog post is a guide to help readers build a neural network from the very basics. It starts with an introduction to the concept of a neural networks concept and its early development. A step-by-step coding tutorial follows, through which relevant concepts are illustrated. Later in the post, there is also an introduction on how to build neural networks in Keras.</description>

      <description>Neural Networks into Production Authors: Mahdi Bayat, Denis Augusto Pinto Maciel, Roman Proskalovich Motivation Training and tuning machine learning model is a hard task. There are many variables involved that can make or break your results. However, also very important is, after fine tuning your model, to be able to deploy it, so it can be accessed by other researchers, developers and applications.
A very common way to accomplish that is by using an API.</description>

      <description>TEST #hugo
import numpy as np import pandas as pd 2+3  A Gentle Introduction to Neural Network Fundamentals 
Imagine the following problem: There are handwritten numbers that you want computer to correctly clasify. It would be an easy task for a person but an extremely complicated one for a machine, especially, if you want to use some traditional prediction model, like linear regression. Even though the computer is faster than the human brain in numeric computations, the brain far outperforms the computer in some tasks.</description>
