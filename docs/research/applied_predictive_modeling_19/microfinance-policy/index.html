<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Is microcredit a miracle or just a hype? While more and more
researches were conducted to study microcredits, people started to
question the effectiveness of microcredit program. This project
explores the heterogeneity of treatment effect on microcredit to
households&rsquo; well-being. Causuall Random Forest and Two-model approach
are used to analyze treatment effects on the household level and
identify the important variables that separate households with higher
treatment effect. The results show evidence of heterogeneity of the
conditional treatment effect on certain aspects of well-being. In
addition, policy suggestions are proposed to attempt to increase the
performance of microfinance program.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Microfinance is a type of credit provided to unemployed or low-income
individuals or groups who are deprived of having access to
conventional financial services. Although it is not a new concept in
human history, as a first organization, Grameen Bank was established
in 1976 by Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh. It provided small loans to
the poor without requiring collateral. The idea was very promising and
it even brought Yunus a Nobel Prize. However, since the 2010 Indian
Microfinance crisis, its effectiveness is in doubt and being discussed
(<a href="#mader2013RiseFallMicrofinance">Mader 2013</a>).  According to Banerjee
et al. (2015) though, microcredit institutions have been effective for
business and social well-being to a certain extent. For the assessment
of the impact of microcredit institutions in the treated area, they
used OLS regressions with area-level control variables and the
indicator for living in a treated area.</p>

<p>$$y_{ia}=\alpha+\beta*Treat _{ia}+X _{\alpha} &lsquo;\gamma +\epsilon _{ia}$$</p>

<p>However, usage of OLS arose two backlashes which this paper tries to
challenge.</p>

<p>First, it assumes if there is a statistically significant on an
indicator, which happened after the experiment being carried out, then
the change must be a result of the treatment. However, it fails to
distinguish people who would have increased or decreased their
well-being regardless of the treatment, in this case, the introduction
of microcredit institutions.</p>

<p>Second, it calculates average treatment effects in the area which is
the difference in average outcomes between areas assigned to the
treatment and areas assigned to the control. By calculating the
average effect, it fails to capture the subgroup in the area which
caused the major difference among the ones who may not have been
affected by the treatment. Heterogeneous treatment effect, on the
other hand, could have been useful to differ the subgroups which are
affected most from the least.</p>

<p>In this paper, the dataset from (<a href="#banerjee2015miraclemicrofinanceevidence">Banerjee
et. al. 2015</a>) has been used
in several uplift models to capture the heterogeneous treatment effect
of easy access to microcredit in the treated areas. By doing so, it is
aimed to find the most affected subgroups from the treatment and to
come up with policy suggestions for the microfinance institutions
accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since the dataset from (<a href="#banerjee2015miraclemicrofinanceevidence">Banerjee
et. al. 2015</a>) paper is
used, it was important to understand how the data is collected and the
experiment is pursued.</p>

<p>The paper (<a href="#banerjee2015MiracleMicrofinanceEvidence">Banerjee
et al. 2015</a>) presents the
results from the randomized evaluation of a group-lending microcredit
program in Hyderabad, India. Microcredit has been lent to groups of 6
to 10 women by a microfinance institution, Spandana. According to the
baseline survey conducted in 2005, 104 neighborhoods with no
pre-existing microfinance was selected. They were paired up and one of
each pair was randomly assigned to the treatment group. Spandana then
progressively began operating in the 52 treatment areas between 2006
and 2007. As an important point to highlight, the treatment was not a
credit take-up but an easy access to microcredit.</p>

<p>This first endline survey was conducted at least 12 months after
Spandana began operating within a given area, and generally 15 to 18
months after, which corresponds to the dates 2007 and 2008. Two years
later, in 2009–2010, a second endline survey, following up on the same
households, was undertaken. In the surveys, the questions related to
the households’ business, consumption, and credit situation as well as
their fixed characteristics and social well-being. Besides, they
calculated index variables from the related variables, which are used
in our analysis.</p>

<h3 id="why-index-variables">Why Index Variables</h3>

<p>Instead of analyzing specific household behaviors such as business
investment or consumption of nondurable goods, as the original paper
did, we want to focus on the more general aspect of the
well-being. This could be done by utilizing the “Index” variables
provided by the dataset.</p>

<p>These index variables are the weighted average of related
variables. For example, business index is the weighted average of
business asset, business expenses, business profit etc. By doing so,
the index variable become a holistic representation of an aspect of
well-being and can capture general condition of that aspect. In the
example above, business index could represent the overall
circumstances of the business activities of the households.</p>

<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>

<p>The paper comes with 5 datasets (<a href="#banerjee2015MiracleMicrofinanceEvidence">Banerjee et
al. 2015</a>), including data
gathered in the first endline survey and the second endline survey as
well as data gathered in the baseline survey.</p>

<p>This project uses mainly the endline dataset, specifically the first
endline data, for analysis. The baseline dataset would be useful to
calculate the changes across time. However, in our case, the index of
households is different between baseline dataset and endline
dataset. Hence we can not make one-to-one mapping between households
in the two datasets. And since we are mainly interested in how easy
accessibility to Spandana microcredits affect households’ well-being,
only the data collected in the first endline survey will be used in
this project.</p>

<p>After cleaning up, the dataset contains 6036 households which
completed the first endline survey and 54 variables, which contains
the information of a household’s basic properties (the household size
<code>hhsize_adj_1</code>, how old is the household head <code>head_age_1</code>), their
financial/loans status (whether they took loans <code>anyloan_1</code>, how many
bank loan they took <code>bank_amt_1</code>), their businesses status if any
(profits <code>bizprofit_1</code>, assets <code>bizassets_1</code>), their monthly
expenditures on various types of good (expenditure on nondurable goods
per capita <code>nondurable_exp_mo_pc_1</code>), and the calculated index
variables.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>While deciding on the methods, we pay attention to pick uplift models
in order to capture incremental impact of the treatment, by which we
could separate the responded group because of the treatment and the
responded group which would have responded anyway.</p>

<p>We picked 2 models:</p>

<ul>
<li>Causal Random Forest</li>
<li>Two-model Approach</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="structure-of-analysis">Structure of Analysis</h3>

<p>This section describes the general structure of the analysis and the
methods used for each task. The details of each method will be
discussed in the next section.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Detect whether the treatment effect on the selected index variable
exhibits heterogeneity.</p>

<p>This is vital as our &ldquo;welfare-enhancing policies&rdquo; is based on the
assumption of targeting only the households with relatively large
treatment effect. Hence if the treatment effect is homogeneous,
which means all households exhibit similar treatment effect, then
the targeting policies would be inefficient.  To perform this
task, Two-model Approach with Sorted Groups Average Treatment
Effect (GATES), which was proposed by Chernozhukov (<a href="#chernozhukov2018GenericMachineLearning">Chernozhukov
et al. 2018)</a>), will be
used.</p></li>

<li><p>Find the variables that separate households with higher treatment
effect.</p>

<p>If the treatment effect is heterogeneous, next thing to do is to
try to separate those high treatment effect households.  For this
task we will use to methods, Causal Random Forest and Two-model
Approach with Random Forest.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Causal Forest: The Signiﬁcance-Based Splitting Criterion</p>

<p>The causal forest’s splitting rule builds trees and mimics the
process that would be used if the treatment eﬀects were
observed (<a href="#hitsch2018HeterogeneousTreatmentEffects">Hitsch &amp; Misra
2008</a>).</p></li>

<li><p>Two-Model Approach</p>

<p>There is no conventional way to get variable importance using
Two-Model Approach. However, given the predicted conditional
treatment effect by Two-model approach we could further fit a
Random Forest model to get the variable importance.</p></li>
</ol></li>

<li><p>Find the thresholds for given variables that could make the
policies more performing.</p>

<p>Narrowing the target could make the policy more efficient and
better performing. Hence after knowing which variables make the
highest impact on households’ treatment effect, our next step is
then to investigate at which values of those variables a household
could benefit the most from the treatment.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, we will first check if there is a pattern of
how the target feature affect the conditional treatment effect and
then use partial dependence plots to find the critical thresholds.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="two-model-approach-and-gates">Two-model Approach And GATES</h3>

<p>Two-model approach was proposed by Chernozhukov et al. as a method for
estimating average treatment effects (<a href="#chernozhukov2016DoubleDebiasedMachine">Chernozhukov et
al. 2016</a>,<a href="#chernozhukov2017DoubleDebiasedNeyman">Chernozhukov et
al. 2017</a>). The concept is
fairly straightforward. Since machine learning has been shown to be
highly effective in prediction, two-model approach exploits this
feature by fitting two independent models, one estimating treatment
effect in the control group and the other in the treatment group. This
way we obtain one model that could be used to predict the “baseline”
outcome, which is defined as the outcomes if the subjects were not
treated, and the other model that could be used to predict the
outcomes if they were treated. Then individual’s conditional treatment
effect is the difference between the predicted baseline outcome and
the predicted treated outcome.</p>

<p>The main advantages of two-model approach are its simplicity and easy
to implement. It requires no additional methods and is generic to
machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Sorted group average treatment effect was also proposed by
Chernozhukov et al. (2018) as one of the strategies to estimate and
make inferences on key features of heterogeneous treatment
effects. (<a href="#chernozhukov2018GenericMachineLearning">Chernozhukov et
al. 2018</a>). GATES first sorts
and groups subjects based on their predicted conditional treatment
effect (as a convention, group #1 should contain subjects with lower
predicted conditional treatment effect and group #5 should contain
subjects with higher predicted conditional treatment effect.) Then use
a weighted OLS</p>

<p>$$Y=\alpha&rsquo;X_1\sum_k^K\gamma_k*(D-p(X))*1(G_k)+v$$</p>

<p>to test whether the average treatment effect differ between groups (
$\gamma_k$ significantly different for some k).</p>

<p>The disadvantages of GATES are that (i) it can not assign individual
into a specific group. As it is recommended to execute the procedure
multiple times to eliminate sampling error, a given household might be
assigned to different groups in each iteration. This therefore makes
it difficult to assign a household into a specific group. (ii) it can
not detect homogeneity. Jacob et al. suggested that GATES has
difficulty detecting homogeneous treatment effect (<a href="#jacobCausalInferenceUsing">Jacob et
al.</a>). They showed that GATES still
indicates heterogeneity, when feeding the simulated data with
homogeneous treatment effect.</p>

<h3 id="causal-random-forest">Causal Random Forest</h3>

<p>Causal random forest is a method for nonparametric statistical
estimation based on random forests (<a href="#wager2018EstimationInferenceHeterogeneous">Wager and Athey
2018</a>), in which the
criteria used for choosing each split during the growth phase of
random forest trades off two desirable properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>maximization of the difference in outcome between the two subpopulations;</li>
<li>minimization of the difference in size between them. (<a href="#radcliffe2011RealWorldUpliftModelling">Radcliffe
et. al. 2011</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end, the count of splits which the variable caused and at which
value reveals the most important variables and its most significant
value.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<h3 id="business-index">Business Index</h3>

<p>The first index variable we choose is business index for the reason
that we believe boosting business activities is a more direct way to
stimulate economic growth.</p>

<p>Studies suggested that small businesses are significant contributors
to economic development, job creation, and general welfare (<a href="#morrison2003SmallBusinessGrowth">Morrison
et al. 2003</a>) meanwhile
entrepreneurial activity plays an important role in economic growth
(<a href="#stel2005EffectEntrepreneurialActivity">Stel et al. 2005</a>). In
addition, according to Spandana’s initial goal of the experiment, the
microcredit program was aimed to provide a better environment for
women in Hyderabad to create their own small businesses. Hence
business index was chosen to be our first target to analyze.</p>

<p>Not all the households being surveyed own businesses. Hence when
analyzing business index, the households without any business (in the
past or at the time) were excluded.</p>

<p>As business index is the weighted average of business related
variables (business assets, profit etc), it is highly correlated to
those variables. For this reason, all those business related variables
were excluded from the dataset. The other index variables
(<code>women_emp_index_1</code>, <code>social_index_1</code>) were also removed in order to
prevent confusing results as they are just the weighted average of a
set of variables already included in the dataset.</p>

<pre><code class="language-r">target_index &lt;- &quot;biz_index_all_1&quot;

endline1_biz &lt;- endline1 %&gt;%
  filter(total_biz_1 != 0) %&gt;%  # filter only the household with a least on business
  select(everything(),
         -hhid,
         -contains(&quot;biz&quot;),   # exclude business related variables
         -contains(&quot;index&quot;), # exclude all index variables
         target_index)       # add back the target index variable
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Heterogeneity of Treament Effect on Business Index</p>

<p>We use GATES with 5 groups ($k$ equals to 5), the same number as
Chernozhukov et al. (2018) used in their paper.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_gates-1.png" alt="GATES Business
Index" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-1: Sorted Groups Average Treatment Effects for Business
Index</em></p>

<p>The result shows that while the average treatment effect for all
households is close to zero, there are signs of heterogeneity, at
least for the fifth and the first group. This supports our
hypothesis that the treatment effect is different for different
groups of households. In addition, the result concludes that about
half of the households have negative treatment effect, which might
lead to the conditional treatment effect being close to zero on
average.</p>

<p>In spite of the treatment being ineffective on average, the
microfinance program could still make great impacts if the policy
targets only the households that have positive treatment effect.</p></li>

<li><p>The Groups Separating Variables</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_varimp-1.png" alt="The Group Separating
Variables" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-1-2: left: Variable Importance predicted by Causal Random
Forest; right: Vriable Importance predicted by Two-model Approach</em></p>

<p>Based on the results of the two methods, we can see that
<code>food_exp_mo_pc_1</code>, the household’s monthly expenditures on food
per household member, <code>health_exp_mo_pc_1</code>, the household’s
monthly health related expenditures per household member,
<code>hhsize_adj_1</code>, the adjusted household size, <code>informal_amt_1</code>, the
amount of informal loans a household has, are among the most
important features that could determine how the treatment affects
a household’s business situation.</p>

<p>One interesting thing to notice is that expenses related variables
dominates the results as most of them are highly important to
separate households with high treatment effect. We could directly
concludes from the result that household expenditures are
important factors that determine the effectiveness of our
treatment. However, the problem is that the relationship of
expenditures and the success of business makes it difficult to
exclude the possibility of endogeneity issue. Does the amount of
expenditures affect how well the business improve from the
treatment or are the changes in expenditures the results of
changes in business status? In this case, the two effects needed
to be separated in order to get reasonable inferences.</p>

<p>There are ways to deal with issues of endogeneity. One well known
method is to construct instrumental variables to mitigate the
problem. However, as a well defined instrumental variable could
not be found in the dataset, this method could not be applied in
this case. The viable albeit imperfect option left is to just
delete those expenditures related variables. Hence for the
following analysis, the dataset with expenditure variables
(<code>nondurable_exp_mo_pc_1</code>, <code>health_exp_mo_pc_1</code> etc) excluded will
be used.</p></li>
</ol>

<li><p>Heterogeneity of Treament Effect on Business Index</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_gates-1.png" alt="GATES Business Index Without Expenditures
Variables" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-1: Sorted Groups Average Treatment Effects for Business
Index without expenditures variables</em></p>

<p>The result is similar to the above one (Business Index with
expenditure covariates).</p></li>

<li><p>The Groups Separating Variables</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_varimp-1.png" alt="The Group Separating
Variables" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-2: left: Variable Importance predicted by Causal Random
Forest; right: Vriable Importance predicted by Two-model Approach</em></p>

<p>After we exclude expenditure related variables, the results of the
two methods are more aligned and the most important variables then
become “The Amount of Informal Loans”, “Adjusted Household Size”
and “Head Age”. In the following section we will discuss and try
to find the optimum value for each feature.</p></li>

<li><p>Amount of Informal Loans</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_trend_informal_amt-1.png" alt="Scatter Plot
informal_amt_1" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-3: Scatter Plot of Amount of Informal Loans to
Predicted Conditional Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p>Based on the result of Causal Random Forest, we can see that there
is no general pattern of how the amount of informal loans affect
the predicted treatment effect. However, the result of Two-model
Approach shows a slight trend that increasing the amount of
informal loan will decrease the treatment effect.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_pdp_informal_amt-1.png" alt="Partial Dependence Plot
informal_amt_1" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-4: Partial Dependence Plot of Amount of Informal Loans
to Conditional Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p>Next, the partial dependence plots is used to find the critical
values that lead to higher treatment effect. This time, both
models predict that households with larger amount of informal
loans tend to have lower treatment effect. And the optimal amount
of informal loans should be close to zero.</p></li>

<li><p>Adjusted Household Size</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_trend_hhsize_adj-1.png" alt="Scatter Plot
hhsize_adj_1" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-5: Scatter Plot of Adjusted Household Size to
Conditional Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p>We can see that while Causal Random Forest predicts no clear
pattern of how adjusted household size affect conditional
treatment effect. On the other hand, Two-model Approach indicates
that households with adjusted household size being around 5-6 have
relatively higher treatment effect.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_pdp_hhsize_adj-1.png" alt="Partial Dependence Plot
hhsize_adj_1" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-6: Partial Dependence Plot of Adjusted Household Size
to Conditional Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p>The partial dependence plots reflect the above results. Causal
Random Forest tells us that once the adjusted household size is
above 4, the conditional treatment effects become relatively
stable. On the other side, Two-model Approach implies that there
exists an optimal adjusted household size, which is around
4-5. And once the adjusted household size passes the threshold,
the treatment effect starts to diminish.</p></li>

<li><p>Head Age</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_trend_head_age-1.png" alt="Scatter Plot
head_age" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-7: Scatter Plot of Head Age to Conditional Treatment
Effect</em></p>

<p>In the case of head age, the two methods suggest slightly
different results. From the scatter plot, Causal Random Forest
shows almost negligible pattern that increasing the head age
increases the treatment effect. Yet Two-model Approach shows that
as the head age increases, the treatment effect will first
increase then decrease.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/biz_noexp_pdp_head_age-1.png" alt="Partial Dependence Plot
head_age" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-2-8: Partial Dependence Plot of Head Age to Conditional
Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p>Same as the scatter plots, the partial dependence plots also show
somewhat contrasting results. Causal Random Forest indicates that
as the head age increases, the treatment effect tends to increase,
while Two-model Approach suggests the opposite. However, both
methods suggest that there exists an optimal range, which is
around 35-50. Both methods predicts that households with head age
around 35-50 tend to have higher conditional treatment effect.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="women-empowerment-index">Women Empowerment Index</h3>

<pre><code class="language-r">target_index &lt;- &quot;women_emp_index_1&quot;

endline1_woemp &lt;- endline1 %&gt;%
  select(everything(),
         -hhid,

</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Heterogeneity of Treament Effect on Business Index</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_gates-1.png" alt="GATES Women Empowerment
Index" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-3-1: Sorted Groups Average Treatment Effects for Women
Empowerment Index</em></p>

<p>The GATES result shows little difference to the treatment effects
across groups, and the overall average treatment effect is close
to zero. This might conclude that the treatment effect on women
empowerment index is homogeneous and the program did no
significant impact on empowering women.</p>

<p>In this case, we could conclude that because of the homogeneity of
the treatment effect, we cannot find features to target that could
potentially increase the performance of the microfinance program.</p>

<p>However, since the first and the fifth groups are on the edge of
the significance interval, we thought that it&rsquo;s still worth to
further investigate since the loan is given to women leading the
women empowerment index an important target.</p></li>

<li><p>The Groups Separating Variables</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_varimp-1.png" alt="The Group Separating
Variables" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-3-2: left: Variable Importance predicted by Causal Random
Forest; right: Vriable Importance predicted by Two-model Approach</em></p>

<p>In the case of women empowerment index, the results of variable
importance produced by the two methods become fairly different
from each other. In addition, none of the feature is significantly
more important than the others. One of the reasons of this
misaligned result could be because the differences between the
high treatment effect group and the low treatment effect good are
so small. Hence the two methods start to pick up noisy information
that are actually not relevant.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we are curious about whether we can still find the
most efficient value of a given variable in this case. Therefore
we pick <code>durables_exp_mo_pc_1</code>, how much money a household spends
on durable goods monthly per household member, <code>hhsize_adj_1</code>, the
adjusted household size, <code>head_age_1</code>, the age of household head,
to perform the following analysis.</p></li>

<li><p>Durable Goods Expenditures</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_trend_durables_exp-1.png" alt="Scatter Plot
durables_exp_mo_pc_1" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-3-3: Scatter Plot of Durable Goods Expenditures on
Conditional Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p>While the Two-model approach shows that higher durable expenses
lead to higher conditional treatment effect, the result of Causal
Random Forest shows no significant pattern.</p>

<p>In addition, notes that Causal Random Forest always predict
negative treatment effect, which means that our treatment will
always hurt women’s well being in the area. Therefore we do not
take the outcome for durables good into an account.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_pdp_durables_exp-1.png" alt="Partial Dependence Plot
durables_exp_mo_pc_1" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-3-4: Partial Dependence Plot of Durable Goods
Expenditures to Conditional Treatment Effect</em></p></li>

<li><p>Adjusted Household Size</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_trend_hhsize_adj-1.png" alt="Scatter Plot
hhsize_adj" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-3-5: Scatter Plot of Adjusted Household Size on
Conditional Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_pdp_hhsize_adj-1.png" alt="Partial Dependence Plot
hhsize_adj" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-3-6: Partial Dependence Plot of Adjusted Household Size
to Conditional Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p>The patterns are similar in the two methods and partial dependence
plots show that households with adjusted household size around 5
have relatively higher treatment effect. The difference is that
Two-model approach shows two peaks as Causal Random Forest shows
only one.</p></li>

<li><p>Head Age</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_trend_head_age-1.png" alt="Scatter Plot
head_age" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-3-7: Scatter Plot of Head Age on Conditional Treatment
Effect</em></p>

<p>Scatter plots show no significant pattern of how head age
influence conditional treatment effect.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/seminar/apa19-microfinance/woemp_pdp_head_age-1.png" alt="Partial Dependence Plot
head_age" /></p>

<p><em>Figure5-3-8: Partial Dependence Plot of Head Age to Conditional
Treatment Effect</em></p>

<p>The results of partial dependence plots show conflicting
results. While Causal Random Forest predicts that higher head age
leads higher conditional treatment effect, Two-model Approach
predicts the contrasting result that households with lower head
age will have relatively high conditional treatment effect. Again,
this could be because the treatment effect in this case, on women
empowerment index, is in fact homogeneous and the two methods are
trying to solve a nonexistent problem. Hence they produce noisy
results that cannot be interpreted.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="model-comparison">Model Comparison</h2>

<p>Measuring and comparing the performance of our two methods is not
straightforward as calculating MSE (mean square error) or determining
the accuracy. Since in real life causal inference problems, we do not
have the true treatment effect. Then the above mentioned metrics can
not apply under this circumstance as theyneed to compare the predicted
value with the true value.</p>

<p>Usually the metric used to compare the performances of different
uplift methods is Qini score, where the area under the incremental
gains curve was measured. However, considering the target variables we
selected in this project are continuous instead of binary, Qini score
is not suitable in our case. There are ways to circumvent this
issue. For example we could convert the numeric values into binaries
based on some predefined thresholds that indicate whether or not a
household “really” benefit from the treatment. However, defining the
threshold without further information is problematic in
practice. Hence at the end we did not take this approach.</p>

<p>The other comparing method is to use the transformed outcomes as
“true” value and calculate the distance of predicted value and the
transformed outcome (<a href="hitsch2018HeterogeneousTreatmentEffects">Hitsch &amp; Misra
2008</a>). This way the
conventional error measurement, such as mean absolute error (MAE) and
mean square error (MSE), could be implemented to assess the model
performance. For this project we decided to use transformed outcome
approach with mean square error as the error metric when comparing the
performances of the two methods.</p>

<p><br/>
The results show that Two-model Approach is slightly better performing
in both cases.</p>

<h2 id="interpretation-and-policy-suggestions">Interpretation And Policy Suggestions</h2>

<p>Increase in informal loans decrease the positive treatment effect on
business index, meaning that dealing with informal loans could be a
suggestion to the microcredit institution. Different marketing
strategies can be used and institutions can offer more suitable terms
such as low interest rates on loans.</p>

<p>The other results related to the businesses were the optimal head age
and household size which had affected more. These are around 5 for the
household size and between 35-50 for the househead age. Besides, the
optimal household size around 5 has also came up significant for the
women empowerment index too. However, it would be a discriminatory
policy to directly implement. Since the Reserve Bank of India
prohibits banks from discriminating against customers on grounds of
gender, age, religion, caste and physical ability while offering
products and services (<a href="#kulkami2014">Kulkami 2014</a>).</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Both challenges addressed in the motivation part could be undertaken
by the analysis.</p>

<p>By using uplift models which are Causal Random Forest and Two-model
Approach the incremental effect of a treatment is captured and we
tried to find the heterogeneity between subgroups whose business and
women empowerment indexes are affected by the treatment. As a result,
a clear heterogeneity has been found for the business index, could
have not been found for the women empowerment index. In the case of
Business Index, where heterogeneity is found, the results of two
methods are quite similar in the sense that the important variables
and their critical thresholds are very much alike. However, in the
case of Women Empowerment Index, where heterogeneity is not clear, the
results become very different. By interpreting the most important
variables, which came up from the models and their significant value,
some policies are suggested to microcredit institutions for better
targeting.</p>
